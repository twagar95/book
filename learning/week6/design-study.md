# Design Pattern Change Study

We chose the domain of fashion to start our design study on. So what we wanted to
study was the trend of change in fashion colors. To start the study we would gather 
lots of data. The data we would gather would be pictures of fashion from all the 
different fashion outlets we could find. We would then put all of these images into
a database so that we could process information out of them. We would then use an 
image processing algorithm to map the different colors of the different fashion pieces
and move that info into a database. The algorithm would work by analyzing each individual
pixel within the image. It would then return a count of each of the different pixels and 
group them into their respective color categories. We would then analyze the information
we obtained by breaking down what colors were the most popular during an era and analyzing
when the trend started to end or begin. We would then determine what the trends over the 
past ~20 years have been color wise in the fashion world. We could even expand the study
to be trends in colors by specific brand.
