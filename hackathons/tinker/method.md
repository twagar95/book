# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

* How much traffic is there?
* What are the contents of the page?
* What is being forked?
* What are the top google search results?
* What are the number of commits?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.
